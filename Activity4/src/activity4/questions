Exercise 1 of Chapter 8.

Let p be a prima and let a be and integer with p (does not divide) a. Let h(x) = a^x (mod p). Explain why h(x) is not
a good cryptographic hash function.

Exercise 2 of Chapter 8.

Let n=pq be the product of two distinct large primes and let h(x) = x^2(mod n).
a) why is h preimage resistant? (Of course, there are some values, such as 1, 4, 9, 16, ... for which it is easy to
find a preimage. But usually it is difficult).
b) Why is h not strongly collision-free?

Exercise 10 of Chapter 8.

a) Show that neither of the two hash functions of Section 8.2 is preimage resistant. That is, given an arbitrary y
(of the appropriate length), show how to find an input x whose hash is y
b) Find a collision for each of the two hash functions of Section 8.2
