Exercise 2 of Chapter 8.

Let n=pq be the product of two distinct large primes and let h(x) = x^2(mod n).
a) why is h preimage resistant? (Of course, there are some values, such as 1, 4, 9, 16, ... for which it is easy to
find a preimage. But usually it is difficult).
b) Why is h not strongly collision-free?

a) 
It is preimage resistant because once the message is digested by the modulus, it is impossible to take the square root
of without introducing real numbers.


b)
h is not strongly collision free because of euler's theorem. The theorem states that if gcd(a, n) = 1, then
a^phi(n) = 1 mod n. This means that unless x  is p, q or k*n, x^phi(n) = 1. We simply follow the procedure from question 1
(x^2 * x^phi(n) = x^2(mod n)), and it is easy to find collisions.
