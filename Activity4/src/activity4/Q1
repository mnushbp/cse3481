Exercise 1 of Chapter 8.

Let p be a prime and let a be and integer with p (does not divide) a. Let h(x) = a^x (mod p). Explain why h(x) is not
a good cryptographic hash function.

-----------------------------------

h(x) is not collision resistant. Because p is prime and a does not divide p, we know by fermat's theorem that a^p-1 = 1 (mod p).
Thus, if we multiply a^x by a*p-1, resulting in a^x+p-1, we gain a result that has a different exponent (message), but the same
hash (as a^p-1 = 1, a^x * 1 = a^x).
