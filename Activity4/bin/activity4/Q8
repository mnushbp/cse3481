Exercise 6 of Chapter 12.

a) The smallest number needed is three participants. There are three possible Ms that can come out of this (AB, AC, BC). Say B is the cheater - AB and BC will not work, but AC will.

b) The smallest number needed when there is only one try allowed is four. In this case, there are (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD) possible shares. If B is the cheater, AC, AD, CD will all result
in the same answer, having been pulled from the appropriate equation. Any answer involving B will be wrong, and will also vary from the answer of each other answer involving B. Thus, it 
will be easy to determine that B is the cheater, and to isolate the correct key with two of the three remaining secrets.
