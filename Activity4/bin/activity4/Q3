Exercise 9 of Chapter 8.

a) Try to encrypt m with a set of sqrt(N) keys. Try to decrypt c with a different set of sqrt(N) keys. The birthday paradox says that there
is a good chance that there is a match between the first list and the second list. This match is the "meet in the middle" for a dual
encryption, i.e. E(m, K1) = n, E(n, K2) = c, therefore E(E(m, K1), K2) = c. Now that we have two keys that lead from m to c, the question states
that it is trivial to find a K3 that results in the same encryption.

b)
26 possible letters to encrypt (m)
26 possible encrypted letters (c)
26 possible amounts to shift (k)
trivial to find decryption, given encryption
given two encryption keys (shift amounts), a third key with equivalent behaviour is simply the first key plus the second key, mod k

To attack with a birthday attack with two lists of length 6 (6 > sqrt(26)), given one (m, c) pair: add shift amounts from the first list
to m. Subtract the shift amounts from the second list from c. Chances are good that there will be a match. The total shift amount (and 
therefore the key) is the shift amount from m to the match plus the shift amount from the match to c.
