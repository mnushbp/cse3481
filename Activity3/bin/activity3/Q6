Exercise 15

Suppose n is a large odd number. You calculate 2^(n-1)/2 = k(mod n), where k is some integer with k != +/- 1 (mod n)

a) Suppose k^2 != 1 (mod n). Explain why this implies that n is not prime.

b) Suppose k^2 = 1 (mod n). Explain how you can use this information to factor n.

I have no idea. Please post the solution in the feedback.
