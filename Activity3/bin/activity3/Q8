Exercise 19

Let n=pq be the product of two distinct primes.
a) Let m be a multiple of phi(n). Show that if gcd(a,n) = 1, then a^m = 1 (mod p) and (mod q)
b) Suppose m is as in part (a), and let a be arbitrary (possibly gcd(a, n) != 1). Show that a^m+1 = a (mod p) and (mod q)
c) Let e and d be encryption and decryption exponsents for RSA with modulus n. Show that a^ed =e= a (mod n) for all a.
This shows that we do not need to assume gcd(a,n) = 1 in order to use RSA.

a) m is a multiple of phi(n). phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1). Therefore, m = k(p-1)(q-1) for some k.
gcd(a,n) = 1, therefore a and n are coprime.

That's all i got. I imagine I'm going to feel really silly when I read the feedback and see that the answers have been staring me in the face this entire time.
