Exercise 2
a)
n = 55
p = 5
q = 11
e = 3
d=?

p-1 = 4
q-1 = 10

d(3) = 1 mod 40

d = 27

b)

by Euler's theorem, as gcd(m, 55) = 1, m^psi(55) = 1 (mod 55)

psi(55) = psi(5*11) = 4*10 = 40 = A ----> m^A = 1

Assuming de = 1 (mod A), we can write de = 1 + k*A for some integer k. Therefore

c^d = (m^e)^d = m^1+k*A = m * (m^A)^k = m*1^k = m (mod n)

therefore, the ciphertext (c) raised to the decryption exponent (d) yields the plaintext (m)
