Exercise 12

You are trying to factor n = 642401. Suppose you discover that 516107^2 = 7 (mod n) and
that 187722^2 = 2^2 * 7 (mod n).

Use this information to factor n.



516107^2 = 7 (mod 642401)
187722 = 2^2 * 7 (mod 642401)

(516107 * 187722) ^2 = (2 * 7)^2 (mod 642401)

289038^2 =? 14^2 (mod 642401) - no congruence

factor by calculating gcd(289038 - 14, 642401) = 1129
other factor is 642401 / 1129 = 569
