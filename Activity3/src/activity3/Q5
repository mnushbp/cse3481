Exercise 14

Suppose you have two distinct large primes p and q. Explain how you can find an integer x such that:

x^2 = 49 (mod pq), x != +/- 7 (mod pq)

By primality testing, we know that if x^2 = y^2 (mod pq) and x != +/- y (mod pq), x must be composite. Furthermore,
gcd(x - y, n) gives a nontrivial factor of n).

Here, we have gcd(x-7, pq) = factor of pq. As there are only four factors of pq (1, p, q, pq), and we know that two
of them are necessarily excluded (1, pq) by primality testing, we can select x-7 = p, or x-7 = q. Therefore, 
x = p+7 or x = q+7.

Primality testing:Let d = gcd(x-7, pq). If d = pq, then x = y(mod pq), which is assumed not to happen. 
Suppose d = 1. A basic result on divisibility is that is a | bc and gcd(a,b) = 1, then a|c. In this case,
since pq divides x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y) and d = 1, we must have that pq divides x+y, which contradicts the
assumption that x != y (mod pq). Therefore, d != 1 or pq, so d is a nontrivial factor of pq.
