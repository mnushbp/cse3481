Exercise 15

Suppose n is a large odd number. You calculate 2^(n-1)/2 = k(mod n), where k is some integer with k = +/- 1 (mod n)

a) Suppose k^2 =/e= 1 (mod n). Explain why this implies that n is not prime.

b) Suppose k^2 =e= 1 (mod n). Explain how you can use this information to factor n.

a)
if n is prime, 2^n-1 = 1 mod n
we have 2^n-1/2 = +/-1 mod n 
from this, we know that n-1 is even, else k would have to have a decimal component.
Therefore, n is odd.




a) we have k^2 != 1, k = 1



Suppose you have two distinct large primes p and q. Explain how you can find an integer x such that:

x^2 = 49 (mod pq), x != +/- 7 (mod pq)

By primality testing, we know that if x^2 = y^2 (mod pq) and x != +/- y (mod pq), x must be composite. Furthermore,
gcd(x - y, n) gives a nontrivial factor of n).

Here, we have gcd(x-7, pq) = factor of pq. As there are only four factors of pq (1, p, q, pq), and we know that two
of them are necessarily excluded (1, pq) by primality testing, we can select x-7 = p, or x-7 = q. Therefore, 
x = p+7 or x = q+7.
