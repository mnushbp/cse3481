Exercise 5

Let p be a large prime. Suppose you encrypt a message x by computing y =e= x^e (mod p) for some (suitably
chosen) encryption exponent e. How do you find a decryption exponent d such that y^d = x (mod p).

p is prime, therefore gcd (x, p) = 1, therefore x^phi(p) = 1 (mod p). p is prime, so phi(p) = p-1. 
Now, find a number d such that de = 1 (mod p-1). that d is the decryption exponent, by the same logic as
used in normal RSA decryption.
