Exercise 8

In order to increase security, Bob chooses n and two encryption exponents e1, e2. He asks Alice to encrypt
her message m to him by first computing c1 = m^e1 (mod n), then encrypting c1 to get c2 = c1^e2 (mod n).
Alice then sends c2 to Bob. Does this double encryption increase security over single encryption? Why or why not?

No. 

Given current systems, RSA is unattackable. Two times unattackable is still unattackable.

Given a theoretical system that can attack RSA within one lifetime, there are two methods:

1) Factoring n. Once the factorization is broken, it is just as easy to computer d1 and d2 as it is just to
compute d1.

2) Attacking the full keyspace of d. Note that c2 = (m^e1)^e2, which is just m^e1e2. To decrypt this, simply calculate
c2^d1d2. The keyspace of d1d2 is only twice the keyspace of d1, and so is not harder in an exponential sense like
2DES would be.
