No. 

c1 = m^e1 (mod n). This means that m^e1 = c1 + kn for some k. Then re-encrypt: c2 = c1^e2 (mod n), which is c2 + kn. 

Rearranging: c2 = m^e1^e2 ; c2 = (c1 + kn)^e2

What has been done in this case is (m^e1)^e2 mod n. This resolves to m^e1*e2, or m^e3, which is the same as a single RSA encryption.
