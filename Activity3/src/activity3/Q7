Exercise 16

Suppose two users Alice and Bob have the same RSA modulus n and suppose that their encryption exponents 

eA and eB are relatively prime. Charles wants to send the message m to Alice and Bob, so he encrypts to
get ca = m^eA and cb = m^eB (mod n). Show how Eve can find m if she intercepts ca and cb.

ca = m^eA (mod n)
cb = m^eB (mod n)

gcd(eA, eB) = 1. Therefore, eA and eB are invertible mod n, i.e. eA * (inv) = 1 (mod n)
