/*
 *  This is a programming question:*
 *
 * Encrypt the plaintext "Facebook" using DES without any padding or 
 * mode of operation using the key "universe" and output the ciphertext 
 * in binary (use the byteToBin method in util). Next, generate a random 
 * number between 0 and 63; flip that bit in the plaintext; encrypt; and 
 * compute the number of bits in the ciphertext that have flipped as a 
 * result. Re-do this avalanche effect computation several times; average 
 * the results; and write down (in the txt file of this question) the 
 * average number of flipped bits in the ciphertext.
