2) Suppose you encrypt using an affine cipher, then encrypt the encryption using another affine 
cipher (both are working mod 26). Is there any advantage to doing this, rather than using a single 
affine cipher? Why or why not?

No, there is no advantage. The equation to get the plaintext is as follows:

pt = plaintext
c = first ciphertext
c' = final ciphertext
a = multiplicative key for c
b = additive key for c
x = multiplicative key for c'
y = additive key for c'

c' = x*c + y
c = a*pt + b

by substitution, c' = x * (a * pt + b) + y
multiply through the brackets, c' = x * a * pt + x * b + y
let x * a = A, x*b+y = B
now we have c' = A * pt + B <- this is the basic affine algorithm

thus, it is a simple matter of finding the resultant A and B to decrypt, rather than finding two different keys.
