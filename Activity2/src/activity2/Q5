5)Alice is sending a message to Bob using one of the following cryptosystems. In fact, Alice is bored 
and her plaintexts consists of the letter a repeated a few hundred times. Eve knows what system is 
being used, but not the key, and intercepts the ciphertext. For systems a, b, and c, state how Eve 
will recognize that the plaintexts is one repeated letter and decide whether or not Eve can deduce 
the letter and the key. (note: for system c, the solution very much depends on the fact that the 
repeated letter is a, rather than b, c, ...)

a) shift cipher
b) affine cipher
c) hill cipher (with a 2x2 matrix)
