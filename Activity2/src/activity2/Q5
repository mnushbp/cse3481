5)Alice is sending a message to Bob using one of the following cryptosystems. In fact, Alice is bored 
and her plaintexts consists of the letter a repeated a few hundred times. Eve knows what system is 
being used, but not the key, and intercepts the ciphertext. For systems a, b, and c, state how Eve 
will recognize that the plaintexts is one repeated letter and decide whether or not Eve can deduce 
the letter and the key. (note: for system c, the solution very much depends on the fact that the 
repeated letter is a, rather than b, c, ...)

a) shift cipher
b) affine cipher
c) hill cipher (with a 2x2 matrix)

a) The ciphertext will be the same letter repeated, just like the plaintext, revealing to Eve (abstractly)
the contents of the plaintext. Eve cannot deduce the key or original letter because there is no sense to
the message, and therefore no language patterns to recognize.

b) The ciphertext will once more be the same letter repeated. This will reveal once more to Eve that
the plaintext is a single letter repeated hundreds of times, but with no knowledge of the key she has
no way of discerning which letter it is. As well, with no language patterns to analyze in a string of
one repeated letter, there will be no way of determining the key.

c) The ciphertext will be the same as the plaintext. Eve will know this because a resolves to numeric
0, and so given any possible block size n and nxn encryption matrix, the result of multiplying a block
of entirely a's (0,0,...0) with the matrix will be another matrix of entirely a's. A is the only letter
that could possibly do this, and so Eve will be able to discern the plaintext (but not the key).
