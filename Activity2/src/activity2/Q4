4a) The ciphertext ELNI was encrypted by a Hill cipher with a 2x2 matrix. The plaintext is dont. 
Find the encryption matrix.

b) Suppose the ciphertext is ELNK and the plaintext is still dont. Find the encryption matrix. 
Note that the second column of the matrix is changed. This shows that the entire second column of 
the encryption matrix is involved in obtaining the last character of the ciphertext (see end of section 2.7).
