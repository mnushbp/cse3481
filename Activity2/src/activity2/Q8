The only attribute of this encryption that makes it more expensive to attack is the additional time taken
to run the encryption/decryption. The keyspace is the same, as there are still only two keys to find, and
proceeds much as a meet-in-the-middle 2DES encryption would proceed:

Encrypt a block of the known plaintext with all 2^56 keys. Decrypt the same block of the known ciphertext TWICE 
with all 2^56 keys. Note that this does not mean try all permutations, merely use the same key to decrypt the 
ciphertext twice. Store all of the resultant intermeditate potentials. When two intermediates match, there is a
possible positive. Attempt to decrypt another block of the ciphertext with the determined key. If the decryption
is successful, the keys have been found. Otherwise, the match is a false positive and it is necessary to continue
iterating through the keyspace.
