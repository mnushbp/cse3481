1)The ciphertext U C R ws encrypted using the affine function 9x + 2 mod 26. Find the plaintext.

U = 20

pt = 18/9 = 2 = B

C = 3

pt = 1 / 9 > find inverse of 9.

9 * 3 mod 26 = 1, therefore 3 is the inverse
therefore, pt = (3-2)*3 = 3 = C

R = 17

pt = 15/9 = 15*3 = 45 = 19 mod 26 = T

The plaintext is BCT.
