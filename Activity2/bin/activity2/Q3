3) Suppos you have a language with only the three letters a, b, c, and they occur with frequencies 
.7, .2 and .1 respectively. The following ciphertext was encrypted by the Vigenere method (shifts 
are mod 3 instead of mod 26 of course)

Suppose you are told the key length is 1, 2, or 3. Show that the key length is probably 2, and 
determine the most probable key.

Key length 1:

Total: 10
#A: 3 - .3
#B: 5 - .5
#C: 2 - .2

close to uniform distribution, resembling random gibberish. Unlikely

Key length 3:

Part 1:
Total: 4
#A: 1 - .25
#B: 2 - .5
#C: 1 - .25

Part 2:
Total: 3
#A: 1 - .33
#B: 2 - .66
#C: 0 - 0

Part 3:
Total: 3
#A: 1 - .33
#B: 1 - .33
#C: 1 - .33

close to uniform distributions again. Part 2 resembles the given frequencies, but is the only group,
and so can be discounted as an outlier

Key length 2:

Part 1:
Total: 5
#A: 3 - .6
#B: 1 - .2
#C: 1 - .2

Part 2:
Total: 5
#A: 4 - .8
#B: 0 - 0
#C: 1 - .2

in each case, the distributions come close to the given distributions, making a key length of 2 likely

The most likely key for this key length is AA.
