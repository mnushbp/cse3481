Alice and Bob have public/private key pair each. How can Alice send a document 
to Bob so that he would have authentication and non-repudiation. How would your 
answer change if the confidentiality of the transmission is not required. 

Confidential Answer:
1) Alice sends 'handshake' request to Bob, encrypted with Bob's public key.
2) Bob decrypts with private key and encrypts return 'handshake' with alice's
 public key
3) Alice decrypts return handshake. At this point authentication is established,
 as both have used their private keys.
4) Alice sends Bob a request for symmetric encryption using his choice of secret
 key, encrypted with Bob's private key.
5) Bob responds affirmative, along with the secret key, encrypted using Alice's
 private key.
6) Alice encrypts the document with the secret key and sends it to Bob.
7) Bob decrypts the document with his secret key. Alice cannot deny sending the
 document, as it is encrypted with the secret key that only she and Bob know.
 Therefore, non-repudiation is established.
 
Non-confidential answer:
Alice sends the document to Bob encrypted with her private key. Bob has authentication
AND non-repudiation, as Alice is the only one with that private key.
