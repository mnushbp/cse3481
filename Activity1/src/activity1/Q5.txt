Alice and Bob have public/private key pair each. How can Alice send a document 
to Bob so that he would have authentication and non-repudiation. How would your 
answer change if the confidentiality of the transmission is not required. 

1) Alice sends 'handshake' request to Bob, encrypted with Bob's public key.
2) Bob decrypts with private key and encrypts return 'handshake' with alice's public key
