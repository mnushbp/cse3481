Can you think of a known-plaintext cryptanalytic attack (i.e. not brute-force)
 against the Affine cipher? Explain step-by-step how it would work. 
 
1) Compare all letters between the plaintext and ciphertext, and note the
 degree of difference for each letter.
2) As in Question 6, compare the different degrees (although with far more
diversity, now that all letters are known), until the affine variables are
revealed.

MARKING FEEDBACK:
Again simply solve two equations. No need to loop on all possibilities.
