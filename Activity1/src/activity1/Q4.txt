A web site has a public key U and a private key R. You want to send your 
creditcard number M to the site ensuring confidentiality. What do you do? 
And after receiving your credit card, the site wants to send you a confirmation 
number also confidentially but you don't have a public/private key pair. 
How can the site do this?
