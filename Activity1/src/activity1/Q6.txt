Can you think of a known-ciphertext (aka ciphertext only) cryptanalytic attack 
(i.e. not brute-force) against the Affine cipher? Explain step-by-step how it 
would work. 

1) Examine letter frequencies. As 'e' is the most common letter in the english
 language, the ciphertext translation of 'e' will be the most common letter in
 the ciphertext.
2) Once 'e' is isolated, examine the degree of difference from the ciphertext
 character to 'e'.
3) Repeat for the next most common characters
4) For each character, iterate through multiplying that plaintext character's 
 index by the loop's iteration (1, 2, 3...), and then finding the difference in
 index between the resultant character and the ciphertext character. Apply those
 two variables to the next character and see if they produce a result. 
5) Continue iterating until variables are found that agree with the common
 characters' translations.
 
 e.g. given e=z, for steps 4/5, do (e*1=e)+21 = z. Then see if 1 and 21 apply to
 the next most common letter. Then do the same for (e*2=j)+19=z, and so on.
