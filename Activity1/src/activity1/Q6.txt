Can you think of a known-ciphertext (aka ciphertext only) cryptanalytic attack 
(i.e. not brute-force) against the Affine cipher? Explain step-by-step how it 
would work. 

1) Examine letter frequencies. As 'e' is the most common letter in the english
 language, the ciphertext translation of 'e' will be the most common letter in
 the ciphertext.
2) Once 'e' is isolated, examine the degree of difference from the ciphertext
 character to 'e'.
3) Repeat for the next most common characters
4) Compare the different degrees, taking into account the mod 26, and
 mathematically determine the affine variables.
