If Eve were to have access to the channel through which Alice and Bob communicate, she can 
launch the following kinds of attacks: Interruption, Denial of Service, Interception, Traffic 
Analysis, Modification, Masquerade, Fabrication, and Replay. Describe each and indicate it 
is an attack on what (in terms of the CIA). In addition, classify each attack as active or 
passive. How do the terms sniffing and spoofing fit into the above attack terminology? 

Assume that communication is from Alice to Bob

Interruption: stopping the flow of information to Alice or Bob. Active.
Denial of Service: using some means of denying Alice or Bob a means of communication. Active
Interception: acquiring information en route to Alice or Bob. Passive.
Traffic Analysis: examining intercepted communications. Passive.
Modification: changing information en route to Alice or Bob. Active.
Masquerade: communicating with Alice or Bob under a trusted pseudonym. Active.
Fabrication: creating false data to send to Alice or Bob. Active.
Replay: intercepting information en route to Alice or Bob and constantly re-sending that
information in order to analyze the response. Active.

Sniffing: analyzing communications without interfering, i.e. sniffing packets to determine content
Spoofing: creating false data or modifying existing data to gain the appearance of authenticity and
trustworthiness
