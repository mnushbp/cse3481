Can you think of a known-plaintext cryptanalytic attack (i.e. not brute-force)
 against the Affine cipher? Explain step-by-step how it would work. 
 
Given no ciphertext and no method of acquiring ciphertext, there is no possible 
method of attacking the affine cipher, as having the plaintext gives nothing.
