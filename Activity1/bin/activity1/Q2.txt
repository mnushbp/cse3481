If Eve were to have access to the channel through which Alice and Bob communicate, she can 
launch the following kinds of attacks: Interruption, Denial of Service, Interception, Traffic 
Analysis, Modification, Masquerade, Fabrication, and Replay. Describe each and indicate it 
is an attack on what (in terms of the CIA). In addition, classify each attack as active or 
passive. How do the terms sniffing and spoofing fit into the above attack terminology? 

Interruption: Stopping the flow of information to Alice or Bob. Active attack on availability.
Denial of Service: Using some means of denying Alice or Bob a means of communication. Active
attack on availability.
Interception: Acquiring information that is destined to Alice or Bob. Passive attack on 
confidentiality.
Traffic Analysis: examining intercepted communications. Passive attack on confidentiality.
Modification: changing information en route to Alice or Bob. Active attack on integrity.
Masquerade: communicating with Alice or Bob under a trusted pseudonym. Active attack on integrity.
Fabrication: creating false data to send to Alice or Bob. Active attack on integrity.
Replay: intercepting information en route to Alice or Bob and constantly re-sending that
information in order to analyze the response. Active attack on availability and/or integrity
and/or confidentiality.

MARKING FEEDBACK
Replay is an attack on integrity. It can be employed to perform the other kinds of attacks.

Sniffing: analyzing communications without interfering, i.e. sniffing packets to determine content
Spoofing: creating false data or modifying existing data to gain the appearance of authenticity and
trustworthiness
