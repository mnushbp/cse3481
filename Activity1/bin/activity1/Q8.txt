 Can you use the meet in the middle strategy to attack the Affine cipher? 
 Explain step-by-step how it would work. 
 
 Equation to result in CT from PT: CT = ((PT*a)+b)*c)+d -> CT = PT*a*c + b*c + d
 
 a*c = x
 b*c = y
 
 thus, CT = PT*x + y + d
 
 y + d = z
 
 thus, CT = PT*x+z
 
Use the same process as in Q7 to discover the affine variables - double-encrypting
by affine is thwarted by the group property.

MARKING FEEDBACK:

You need to write clear steps to apply meet in the middle!

ME FEEDBACK: 

Maybe go through all potentials for a for each b mod 26 (i.e. a = 1, b = 0, 1, 2...26, a=2, b=0,1,2...)
for each encryption and find when they match, then try on next letter until match is found
