 Can you use the meet in the middle strategy to attack the Affine cipher? 
 Explain step-by-step how it would work. 
 
1) Compare all letters between the plaintext and ciphertext, and note the
 degree of difference for each letter.
2) Compare the different degrees, taking into account the mod 26, and
 mathematically determine the affine variables.
