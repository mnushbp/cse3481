Alice and Bob have a shared secret key. Argue that a when Bob receives an encrypted 
document from Alice, he would be confident that she sent it (authentication assured)
yet she can deny sending it (origin non-repudiation not assured). 

It is possible that Alice may have shared her secret key. As Bob is unaware that
Alice has done this, he is convinced that she is the only other person with this
key. Thus, anything that was sent with Alice's encryption would naturally be 
assumed to have come from her. However, as Alice has shared this key without Bob's
knowledge, whoever Alice may have shared the key with now has the ability to
encrypt documents in the same fashion.

MARKING FEEDBACK:
We assume it is a secret key. So, we can't consider this case.

ME FEEDBACK:

Authentication assured: bob knows that only alice has the key, and knows that he didn't
send it, so she must have
Origin non-repudiation: alice can claim that bob sent the message himself, and bob can't
deny it
