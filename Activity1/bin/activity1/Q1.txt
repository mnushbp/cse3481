Name the three components of the so-called CIA Triad and provide a brief description of each. 
The terms authentication, authorization, and non-repudiation are also often mentioned as desired 
services for computer / information security. What do they mean? 

C: Confidentiality. Private information should remain secret to all those but the intended recipient.
I: Integrity. Information sent should remain accurate over its lifecycle, and should not be modified
in an unauthorized or undetectable manner.
A: Availability. Data and communication should be visible and accessible to its intended user or recipient.


Authentication: Ensuring that all parties who are privy to information are who they say they are, and
that the information is genuine.
Authorization: Ensuring that all parties who can view information are permitted to by the owner/sender of
said information
Non-repudiation: The concept that all 'acceptors' of a contract will fulfill the terms of that contract.
In context, the concept that a sender will not claim to not have sent information, and that the recipient
will not claim to not have recieved the information.
